# Introduction to Java
Java is a **class-based**, **object-oriented** programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

## Hello World

```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, BrainCache!");
    }
}
